### REGISTER NUMBER : 212222040158
### AIM: 
For ATM system study its system specifications and report various bugs
### Purpose:
```
This document describes the software requirements and specification (SRS) for an automated 
teller machine (ATM) network. The document is intended for the customer and the developer 
(designers, testers, maintainers). The reader is assumed to have basic knowledge of banking 
accounts and account services. Knowledge and understanding of Unified Modeling Language 
(UML) diagrams is also required.
```

### Scope:
```
The software supports a computerized banking network called ‗Bank24„. The network 
enables customers to complete simple bank account services via automated teller machines 
(ATMs) that may be located off premise and that need not be owned and operated by the 
customer’s bank. The ATM identifies a customer by a cash card and password. It collects 
information about a simple account transaction (e.g., deposit, withdrawal, transfer, bill 
payment), communicates the transaction information to the customer’s bank, and dispenses 
cash to the customer. The banks provide their own software for their own computers. The 
‗Bank24„ software requires appropriate record keeping and security provisions. The 
Software must handle concurrent accesses to the same account correctly.
```

### Intended Audience:
```
The intended audience of this SRS consists of: 
□ Software designers 
□ Systems engineers 
□ /Software developers 
□ Software testers 
□ Customers 
The actors of the system are: 
1. User 
2. ATM Machine 
3. Bank
```


### Product Perspective:
```
An automated teller machine (ATM) is a computerized telecommunications device that 
provides the customers of a financial institution with access to financial transactions in a 
public space without the need for a human clerk or bank teller. On most modern ATMs, the 
customer is identified by inserting a plastic ATM card with a magnetic stripe or a plastic 
smartcard with a chip, that contains a unique card number and some security information, 
such as an expiration date or CVC (CVV). Security is provided by the customer entering a 
personal identification number (PIN).
